    <h2>The Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Different review sites for different things: Google for restaurants, Booking.com for hotels, TripAdvisor for tours.</li>
      <li>The same experience might warrant reviews on multiple platforms.</li>
      <li>No place to capture raw thoughts right after an experience, before you forget the details.</li>
      <li>Polishing a quick note into a proper review happens later - but where did you put that note?</li>
      <li>When writing your travel journal, you want to reference your reviews but can't remember where you posted them.</li>
      <li>Reviews you write are scattered and disconnected from your trip record.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>A central place to capture, refine, and track all your trip reviews:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Capture in the moment</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Quick notes right after an experience while details are fresh.</li>
          <li>Link reviews to locations from your trip.</li>
          <li>Rate and categorize (restaurant, hotel, activity, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Refine at your pace</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Draft and polished versions of each review.</li>
          <li>Edit and improve when you have time.</li>
          <li>No pressure to post immediately.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Post where it matters</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy to Google, TripAdvisor, Booking.com, or wherever is appropriate.</li>
          <li>Track where you've posted each review.</li>
          <li>Future: direct posting integration.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Connected to your journal</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Reference reviews while writing journal entries.</li>
          <li>Pull quotes and details into your travelog.</li>
          <li>Complete record of your trip experiences.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Existing Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Maps</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Convenient for restaurant reviews - visible where people search.</li>
          <li>Reviews live on Google, not connected to your trip.</li>
          <li>No draft workflow; post immediately or lose your thoughts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Booking.com</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Verified stay reviews carry credibility.</li>
          <li>Only for accommodations booked through them.</li>
          <li>Reviews belong to Booking.com, not your trip record.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>TripAdvisor</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Broad coverage of tours, activities, and attractions.</li>
          <li>Increasingly cluttered with ads and sponsored content.</li>
          <li>No connection to your other trip data.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Notes apps</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexible for capturing thoughts.</li>
          <li>No structure, categorization, or trip context.</li>
          <li>Easy to forget where you put things.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
