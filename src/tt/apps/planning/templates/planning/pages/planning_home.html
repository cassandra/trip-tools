    <h2>The Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Research and comparison of options is scattered across browser tabs, notes, and spreadsheets.</li>
      <li>No central place to track candidates for lodging, transportation, activities, etc.</li>
      <li>Hard to compare options side-by-side with custom attributes that matter to you.</li>
      <li>Decisions made during planning don't flow into bookings and itinerary.</li>
      <li>When planning with others, everyone has their own separate research.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A central place to collect and organize all your trip options.</li>
      <li>Group candidates by type (lodging, flights, activities, restaurants, etc.).</li>
      <li>Add custom attributes for comparison (price, distance, amenities, ratings).</li>
      <li>Rank and prioritize options with preference ordering.</li>
      <li>Seamless flow from planning decisions to bookings and itinerary.</li>
      <li>Shared planning workspace for trip collaborators.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Existing Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexible for custom comparisons, but disconnected from other trip data.</li>
          <li>Hard to share and collaborate on effectively.</li>
          <li>No integration with booking or itinerary workflows.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Browser Bookmarks</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Quick to save links, but no structure or comparison capability.</li>
          <li>Easy to lose track of what you've already researched.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Note-taking Apps</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Good for freeform notes, but lack structured comparison features.</li>
          <li>Not purpose-built for trip planning workflows.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
