  <h2>The Problems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Building an itinerary means manually copying information from bookings, research, and notes.</li>
    <li>When plans change, you update the itinerary separately from the booking - easy to get out of sync.</li>
    <li>Not everything in your day is a booking (walking tours, free attractions, meals), but it still needs to be in the itinerary.</li>
    <li>Hard to see if your day is realistic: travel times, opening hours, and logistics aren't connected.</li>
    <li>Sharing the itinerary with travel companions means exporting or screenshot workflows.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>An itinerary deeply integrated with your trip data that stays current automatically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Connected to locations</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Add locations directly to your itinerary.</li>
        <li>See addresses, hours, and notes without switching contexts.</li>
        <li>Map view shows each day's geography.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Linked to bookings</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookings automatically appear in your itinerary.</li>
        <li>Changes to bookings update the itinerary.</li>
        <li>Clear distinction between booked and unbooked activities.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Flexible daily planning</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Mix bookings with free activities, meals, and downtime.</li>
        <li>Reorder and adjust as plans evolve.</li>
        <li>Notes and reminders for each day.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Shared with your group</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>All trip members see the same itinerary.</li>
        <li>Changes sync automatically.</li>
        <li>No export/import workflows needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Existing Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TripIt</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Good at parsing confirmation emails into itinerary items.</li>
        <li>Assumes everything is a booking - awkward for free activities.</li>
        <li>User interface feels dated and clunky.</li>
        <li>Limited development since acquisition; API discontinued.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wanderlog</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Modern interface with good map integration.</li>
        <li>Itinerary building is manual; limited booking integration.</li>
        <li>Free tier is restrictive; pushes toward paid plans.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Completely flexible but entirely manual.</li>
        <li>No connection to locations, maps, or bookings.</li>
        <li>Collaboration works but lacks trip-specific features.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
