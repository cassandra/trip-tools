  <h2>The Problems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Information about places is scattered across bookmarks, notes, messages, and your memory.</li>
    <li>No central place to track what you know about a location: who recommended it, ratings, hours, pricing, booking status.</li>
    <li>Hard to see all your places on a map to understand geography and plan logistics.</li>
    <li>Location data doesn't flow into other trip activities (itinerary, bookings, journal).</li>
    <li>When someone asks "where should we eat near the museum?" you're back to searching from scratch.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>Location as the central organizing concept that ties all trip data together:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rich location profiles</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Store recommendations, sources, and why it's on your list.</li>
        <li>Track ratings, hours, pricing, and contact info.</li>
        <li>Note booking requirements and status.</li>
        <li>Link to your reviews after visiting.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Map integration</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>See all locations plotted geographically.</li>
        <li>Understand distances and clusters for daily planning.</li>
        <li>Use during the trip for navigation context.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Connected to everything</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Locations feed into transportation and lodging decisions.</li>
        <li>Locations anchor your daily itinerary.</li>
        <li>Locations appear in your journal entries.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Existing Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Maps</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Great for visual plotting and navigation.</li>
        <li>Saved places and lists are too basic for trip planning.</li>
        <li>"My Maps" is more capable but has a clunky interface and limited attributes.</li>
        <li>Doesn't integrate with itinerary, bookings, or journaling.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wanderlog / Tripit</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Include location features tied to itinerary.</li>
        <li>Limited flexibility for pre-trip research and comparison.</li>
        <li>Locations are secondary to the itinerary, not first-class objects.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Notes / Spreadsheets</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexible but no map visualization.</li>
        <li>Manual effort to maintain and cross-reference.</li>
        <li>Disconnected from other trip tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
