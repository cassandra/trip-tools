  <h2>The Problems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirmations are scattered across email, apps, and PDFs - no single view of what's booked.</li>
    <li>No clear connection between "things to book" and "things already booked."</li>
    <li>Booking to-dos require separate task lists and calendar reminders.</li>
    <li>Bookings and itinerary are related but managed separately - easy to lose sync.</li>
    <li>Tracking who paid for what and splitting costs requires yet another app.</li>
    <li>Cancellation policies and deadlines are buried in confirmation emails.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>Bookings as the financial and operational layer of your trip, tightly connected to your itinerary:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unified booking view</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>All bookings in one place: flights, hotels, activities, restaurants.</li>
        <li>Link to confirmation details and reference numbers.</li>
        <li>Track booking status: confirmed, pending, cancelled.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>To-book task management</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Track what still needs to be booked.</li>
        <li>Set deadlines and reminders for time-sensitive bookings.</li>
        <li>Convert to-book items into confirmed bookings.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Financial tracking</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Record costs, payment methods, and charge dates.</li>
        <li>Track cancellation policies and refund deadlines.</li>
        <li>Split expenses among trip members.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Itinerary integration</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookings automatically appear in your itinerary.</li>
        <li>Changes stay synchronized.</li>
        <li>Clear view of what's booked vs. planned but not yet booked.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Existing Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TripIt</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Good at parsing confirmation emails into booking records.</li>
        <li>No concept of "to-book" items - only tracks what's already booked.</li>
        <li>Limited financial tracking; no expense splitting.</li>
        <li>API discontinued; limited integration options.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tricount / Splitwise</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Excellent for splitting expenses among a group.</li>
        <li>Completely disconnected from trip planning and itinerary.</li>
        <li>Manual entry of every expense.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Email + Spreadsheets</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Search email for confirmations; track costs in a spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>Entirely manual and error-prone.</li>
        <li>No reminders, no status tracking, no integration.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
