    </p>
    <p>
      By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree,

    </p>

    <h5 class="text-primary mt-4">Account Security</h5>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for maintaining access to the email address associated with your account,

      generated for your account, including those used by the browser extension.

      resulting from unauthorized access to your account or misuse of your API keys.

    <h5 class="text-primary mt-4">Your Content</h5>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of all content you create, including trip information, journal entries,

    <h5 class="text-primary mt-4">Browser Extension</h5>

      service of any third-party websites you access through the extension. The extension uses your
      browser's existing sessions to access these services; we do not store third-party credentials.
