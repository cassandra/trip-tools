      We believe your travel data is yours. Here's how we handle it.
    </p>

    <ol class="pl-4">
      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">We only collect what you give us.</strong>
        Your email address is required for your account. Your name is optional.
        Trip data (titles, descriptions, locations, maps) is only stored when you explicitly create or save it.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">We only use your data to provide the service.</strong>
        Your trip information is used solely to display it back to you and to people you explicitly invite to share a trip.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">We don't track you.</strong>
        No third-party analytics, no advertising trackers, no behavioral profiling.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">We don't sell or share your data.</strong>
        Your information stays between you, the people you invite, and our servers. That's it.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">The browser extension stores minimal data locally.</strong>
        This includes your session token (so you stay logged in) and cached trip information (so the popup loads quickly).
        This data never leaves your device except to communicate with our servers.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">Third-party services use your browser's authentication.</strong>
        The extension integrates with services like Google Maps and Google My Maps to help you collect and organize travel data.
        When accessing these services, the extension uses your browser's existing sessions.
        We don't participate in third-party authentication or store any third-party credentials.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">We only use necessary cookies.</strong>
        Session cookies keep you logged in. No tracking cookies.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">You can delete your data anytime.</strong>
        Contact us to request complete deletion of your account and all associated trip data.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary">We communicate only when necessary.</strong>
        We'll email you for account verification and critical service notifications. No marketing spam.
