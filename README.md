# Trip Tools

Open source trip planning, management, and journaling.

## Try It Now

Visit **[triptools.net](https://triptools.net)** to create your first travel journal in minutes. No setup required.

## Why Trip Tools?

**The Problem:** There are lots of good tools for managing trips. Why is that a problem? Because you need to use *lots* of tools.

A trip isn't just planning, or just managing bookings, or just sharing photos. Tools tend to focus on one piece of the puzzle, creating data silos. The burden falls on you to juggle them all: cutting and pasting, multiple logins, different formats. Planning with others just makes it worse - now you need to share a slew of different services and documents.

**Our Solution:** We view the entire lifecycle of a trip as one problem. Pre-trip research, comparisons, bookings, data needed during travel, post-trip journaling and photo sharing - all connected and accessible from a single place.
