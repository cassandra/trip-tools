Pick up GitHub issue #$1 following our development workflow from docs/dev/workflow/workflow-guidelines.md:

## Issue Pickup Process for #$1

Execute the complete issue pickup workflow:

1. **Use TodoWrite to plan the pickup process** - Track all workflow steps
   - Read `docs/CLAUDE.md` for development philosophy and workflow integration
   - Focus on well-factored solutions and quality over speed

2. **Read the GitHub issue and all comments** - Understand requirements, context, and discussion using `gh issue view $1`

3. **Complexity Assessment** - Evaluate if pickup is appropriate:
   - **STOP and use `/plan` if:**
     - Issue affects multiple apps/systems
     - Requires breaking changes or major refactoring
     - Scope unclear or too large for single PR
     - Epic-level work requiring decomposition
   - **STOP and use `/investigate` if:**
     - Implementation approach unclear
     - Requires significant codebase research
     - Complex technical challenges or unknowns
     - Integration between multiple systems
   - **STOP and use `/design` if:**
     - Requests "better styling" or "improved layout"
     - Mentions UI/UX improvements
     - Needs mockups or wireframes
     - Visual design decisions required
   - **ESCALATE to `/execute` if:**
     - Multiple technical domains require coordination
     - Issue has functional boundaries divisible among agents
     - Cross-system impacts need expert specialization
     - Implementation phases with dependencies between specialties
     - Work requires backend + frontend + integration coordination
   - **Continue with pickup if:**
     - Single domain/file change with clear solution
     - Bug fix with identified root cause and location
     - Simple enhancement using existing patterns
     - Atomic task suitable for single agent
     - No coordination between technical specialties needed

4. **Ensure on latest staging branch** - MANDATORY safety step:
   - Verify current branch and working directory status
   - Switch to staging: `git checkout staging`
   - Pull latest: `git pull origin staging`
   - Verify clean state: `git status`

5. **Assign issue to yourself** - Use: `gh issue edit $1 --add-assignee @me`

6. **Create feature branch immediately** - Use proper naming from `docs/dev/workflow/workflow-guidelines.md`:
   - Determine branch type from issue labels/content (feature/bugfix/docs/ops/refactor)
   - Create branch: `git checkout -b [type]/$1-[mnemonic]`
   - Push branch: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`

7. **Investigation and planning** - Research the codebase:
   - Search for relevant code, components, and files
   - Identify affected areas and dependencies
   - Understand current implementation
   - Plan implementation approach

8. **Post investigation comment to GitHub issue** - Document:
   - Summary of investigation findings
   - Proposed implementation approach
   - Key files/components to be modified
   - Any questions or concerns identified
   - Multi-phase strategy if applicable (following workflow-guidelines.md)

**Critical requirements:**
- Follow exact workflow from `docs/dev/workflow/workflow-guidelines.md`
- Follow branch naming conventions from `docs/dev/workflow/workflow-guidelines.md`
- Create feature branch BEFORE any investigation work
- Always verify clean working directory before branch operations
- Post comprehensive investigation findings to GitHub issue
