Create pull request with title "$1" following our workflow from `docs/dev/workflow/workflow-guidelines.md`:

## Pull Request Creation Process

Execute the complete PR creation workflow:

1. **Use TodoWrite to plan PR creation steps** - Track all required checks

2. **MANDATORY pre-PR requirements** - Both must pass before PR creation:
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite (must pass)
   make test

   # Run code quality check (must pass with no output)
   make lint
   ```
   **CRITICAL**: Do not create PR if either check fails. Fix all issues first.

3. **Gather PR information** - Collect required details:
   - Current branch name and recent commits
   - **Detect correct base branch** using `git remote show origin` to find HEAD branch
   - Related GitHub issue number(s)
   - Summary of changes made
   - Testing performed
   - Documentation updates needed

4. **Create PR using GitHub CLI** - Follow exact template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

   **CRITICAL**: Use file-based approach to prevent escaping failures:
   ```bash
   # Detect the correct base branch from remote HEAD
   BASE_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch:' | cut -d' ' -f5)
   if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
     echo "Warning: Could not detect base branch, falling back to 'main'"
     BASE_BRANCH="main"
   fi
   echo "Using base branch: $BASE_BRANCH"

   # Write PR body to temporary file first
   cat > /tmp/pr_body.md <<'EOF'
